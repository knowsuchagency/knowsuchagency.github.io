## What's a monad?

You'll get a lot of different answers on the definition of a monad, depending on who you ask.

If you want the complete and correct answer, the best way to get it is probably [from the source](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html).

Here's my take on it, though...

---

* monads are a pattern for *composing* computations
* they act as containers for values and computations on those values.
* you can compose monads together, but those compositions have to follow certain rules.

---

The fact that a correct implementation of a monad follows some special composition rules is what ultimately makes them useful.

Languages that have verifiably correct implementations of monads as part of their standard library and provide syntactic sugar around their composition (i.e. Haskell, Scala) provide users of those languages a combination of expressive power and guarantees about correctness at compile-time, which is awesome. 

---

So, as I've mentioned in a previous post, monads have been implemented and written about a lot in other languages (like Scala and Haskell) more than in Python. Since Python is the language I primarily use, I wanted to implement my own monad in the language to get a better understanding of the topic.

There are other projects that have sought to do the same such as [OSlash](https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash) and [PyMonad](https://pypi.org/project/PyMonad/) but I think the best way to learn certain things is to do them oneself. 

Also, as far as I could tell, neither project (or any others I could find in the Python ecosystem) use property-based testing to guarantee that their monad implementations are correct; they seem to use hard-coded values in their test suites to test the monad laws. *Note: Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not criticizing the projects at all and it could be possible I'm missing something*

---

I wanted to see if I could use property-based testing through [hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/tree/master/hypothesis-python) to programmatically verify that my monad implementation was correct.


After a lot of trial-and-error, the following implementation of the identity monad is what I came up with.



```python
"""
A basic implementation of the identity monad in python.

We use the hypothesis library to test that our monad obeys
the monad, applicative, and functor laws.

# Conclusion

I had a lot of ~~head-scratching~~ fun implementing and testing the identity monad in Python.

Although the implementation stops short of being useful, I still think it's informative as a reference.

It might not be a ton more effort to extend the code above to do useful things.

For example, one could inherit from the `Identity` monad to implement the `Maybe` or `Result`, perhaps overloading the `__rshift__` operator for monadic `bind` to provide some neat, untuitive facilities around error-handling.

I'm probably not going to do it myself, though. The reason for this is because although doing so would be an interesting intellectual exercise, I think it's best to stick to a particular language's idioms with respect to things like control-flow and error-handling.

Something else I've come to opine as I worked on this implementation is that you can get pretty far with structures that are "weaker" than monads. For example, python's built-in `list` may not obey all the `Functor` laws, but that doesn't mean it isn't useful to be able to `map` over one.

Similarly, the Rust language may not have built-in monad implementations, but it already provides tremendous value simply by having algebraic datatypes (some with their own syntactic sugar) like `Option` and `Result`. They don't need to be complete monad implementations to be extremely useful.
