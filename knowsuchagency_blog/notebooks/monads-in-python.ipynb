    "I'm probably not going to do it myself, though. The reason for this is because although I think it might be an interesting intellectual exercise, I think it's best to stick to a particular language's idioms with respect to things like control-flow and error-handling, especially when working with teams of people.\n",

    "Something else I've come to opine as I worked on this implementation is that you can get pretty far with structures that are \"weaker\" than monads. For example, python's built-in `list` may not obey all the `Functor` laws, but that doesn't mean it isn't useful to be able to `map` over one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Rust language may not have built-in monad implementations, but it already provides tremendous value simply by having algebraic datatypes (some with their own syntactic sugar) like `Option` and `Result`. They don't need to be complete monad implementations to be extremely useful."
